    <h2>Obituary</h2>
  <div class="obituary-text">
    <p>J.J. Samuel's long life (indeed a blessed octogenarian) is a saga of pure love, faith, courage, and sacrifice for his family and motherland, India. Samuel embodied values of simplicity, patriotism, perseverance, adventure, and bravery.</p>

    <p>Samuel was born in Wanaparthy on June 16, 1943, and grew up there until his teens, and finished his studies in MB Central High School in Mahabubnagar town. He passed into eternal glory on October 29, 2025, after a brief battle with illness.</p>

    <p>Raised by his disciplined and devout parents late Rev. J.J. John and the late Mrs. Lilamma, the early life of Samuel, their fourth son, was largely shaped and impacted by their spiritual upbringing and faithful prayers.</p>

    <p>He responded to the call of national duty, joining the armed forces of post-independent India while he was still young. Blessed with a good physique and athletic acumen, the young Samuel quickly imbibed and embraced the military skills and was drafted in major wars fought back-to-back with neighbouring nations, Pakistan, and China (early 60s and early 70s). Following in his footsteps, Samuel’s younger brother J.J. David also joined the military service and both served the country with pride, distinction, and honour.</p>

    <p>While serving the Indian Army in the sensitive border areas of Assam, Delhi, and Jammu & Kashmir, Samuel never forgot his large family, especially his pastoral parents and younger sisters and brothers. He was one of the pillars of support, sending them financial help and meeting their physical needs while his parents were busy in the Lord’s ministry, planting and pastoring Mennonite churches in the Mahabubnagar district.</p>

    <p>Even after taking a military discharge on medical grounds due to a major surgery and returning home along with his wife and children, Samuel never relaxed or rested but continued to strive and support his family of four young children.</p>

    <p>Undaunted by the challenges of starting his mid-life afresh, Samuel scouted for employment and soon landed a stable job with the nationalized State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) and worked for over two decades in the SBH branches of Shadnagar and Wanaparthy towns. He never sought help from anyone during difficult times of transition but showed tremendous resolve and resilience while continuing to be the sole breadwinner and family provider. All along, he showed fatherly love of labour, commitment, and sacrifice, investing his hard-earned money, effort, and time in boosting the education and employment prospects of his children.</p>

    <p>He built a spacious home in Shadnagar and later transferred to Hyderabad seeking better opportunities for his family. Samuel built another beautiful house (current) in Vanasthalipuram, where he stayed and lived until his last breath.</p>

    <p>In all of the places he lived and worked, he lived a life pleasing to God and witnessed Christ's love, peace, and compassion by his exemplary life to others among his work colleagues, friends, and relatives. He was also quite involved and engaged in the local community and loved the local church here, its pastors, and congregation.</p>

    <p>Earlier, the hand of God can also be clearly observed and discerned in Samuel’s bachelor’s life. While still serving in the army in North India, he got married to Grace Chintha, daughter of an equally God-fearing large family of late Mrs. and Mr. Chintha Ratnam, who were affiliated with the Hebron church in Hyderabad. Both were united in Holy Matrimony in Hebron Church on September 21, 1976.</p>

    <p>They are blessed with two sons—Elisha, the eldest, and Danny (Honey), the youngest—and two daughters—Jerusha Jeniffer (Lovely) and Hannah Betty (Dolly)—all married and blessed with their children and comfortably settled. Honey lives in the USA (Maryland) with his wife Rachel and son Judah. Samuel and Grace were blessed with six beautiful grandchildren, including five grandsons and one granddaughter.</p>

    <p>We covet your prayers for God’s continued leading and guidance over our lives and be comforted especially in the absence of both parents. Samuel is preceded in death by his beautiful and gracious wife, Grace Chintha, who went to be with our Lord during COVID. She stood by his side as an unwavering partner in life’s ups and downs. Together, they built a beautiful family grounded in faith and mutual love.</p>

    <p>As Christ’s followers, we affirm our hope and belief that both are now happily reunited in heaven, just as God desires all of us one day to be with Him in eternal bliss, freed from all bodily infirmities, pain, and suffering. While we deeply mourn the loss of such a remarkably kind, simple, generous, and loving person, we also celebrate the extraordinary and exemplary life of courage and faith he led and the lasting impact he made. We take comfort in the promise of eternal life and rejoice in the hope that we will one day be reunited in heaven.</p>
